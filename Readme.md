The data set used is Human Activity Recognition usign smartphones can be obtained [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The R script run_analysis.R contains following tasks.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the means and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
